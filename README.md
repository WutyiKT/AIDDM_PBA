**Introduction:**

**This project is designed to optimize the LSTM model which predict the closing price of Micron Technology stock** 
**The followings are the main objectives for this project.**
- To implement the LSTM model for stock closing price prediction.
- To utilize the different optimization algorithms such as RMSprop and Adam which are commonly used for neural networks.
- To evaluate and analyze the performance of both optimization algorithms.
